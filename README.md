# **Leet-Vise**  
_A lightweight CLI tool to practice and revise your LeetCode questions._

---

## Introduction

**Leet-Vise** is your personal **LeetCode revision companion**.  
It fetches coding problems from your **Notion database**, stores them locally as JSON, and then lets you **practice them directly in your terminal** ‚Äî complete with hints, solutions, and a countdown timer.  

You‚Äôll need to **use the provided Notion template** for storing your questions.  As you solve problems on LeetCode (or elsewhere), **log them in your Notion database** with details like title, link, difficulty, hint, and solution. Later, Leet-Vise will pull from this list to pick random problems for you to revise. Then you can just open the link and start practicing. 

You can run it purely offline (using your cached data) or update the questions anytime from Notion with a single command.  

Perfect for:
- üîÑ Consistent revision without distractions  
- üíª Practicing from your own curated problem list  
- ‚è≥ Staying focused with a live custom timer
